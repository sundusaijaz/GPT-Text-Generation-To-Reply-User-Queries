### GPT-based Text Generation for User Query Responses

This project involves utilizing the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, specifically the GPT-3 (such as Davinci), to respond to user queries extracted from a conversation dataset between customers and shop owners. The process includes cleaning raw data using regular expressions and Spacy to extract the queries and responses, which are then used to train the GPT model.

#### Project Objective

The primary goal is to clean and structure raw conversation data, extract the queries and corresponding answers, and use this information to train the GPT model. The trained GPT model is then capable of generating responses to similar queries, facilitating automated interactions with users in a conversational manner.

### Key Components

#### 1. Data Cleaning with Regex and Spacy
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the raw conversation data to extract useful information like queries and corresponding responses.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Employing regex patterns to identify and extract specific segments of text, such as queries and answers.
- **Spacy for Text Processing:** Leveraging Spacy, a natural language processing library, for efficient text manipulation and extraction.

#### 2. GPT Model Training
- **GPT (Davinci) Model Training:** Utilizing the OpenAI GPT-3 model (Davinci) and its API for training on the structured conversation data.
- **JSON File Creation:** Structuring the data in a JSON format to train the GPT model effectively.

#### Workflow Overview
The workflow can be divided into the following stages:
1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning:**
   - Using regex and Spacy to clean and structure the raw conversation data, isolating the user queries and corresponding responses.
2. **JSON File Preparation:**
   - Creating a structured JSON file containing the cleaned data for training the GPT model.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Leveraging the OpenAI GPT-3 (Davinci) model API to train the model on the prepared JSON dataset.

### Application Areas
- **Customer Support Automation:** Generating automated responses to user queries for customer support purposes.
- **Chatbot Development:** Building chatbots capable of natural and coherent interactions with users.

### Future Developments
- Refining the cleaning process for more accurate extraction of queries and responses.
- Incorporating more advanced NLP techniques for better data preparation and training.

### Considerations
- Data quality and accuracy are crucial for effective training and subsequent response generation by the GPT model.

#### Final Note
This project focuses on leveraging GPT-3 (Davinci) for training on structured conversation data, allowing the model to generate responses to user queries. Further information regarding specific data cleaning techniques, training methodologies, and GPT model interactions can be found in the project's documentation and code files.
